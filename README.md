## üì© Installing on PS4
**NOTE: You WILL need a JAILBROKEN (GoldHen 2.3.0+) PS4 in order to play this mod on console. We hope this is clear.**

download the latest release of the [GoldHEN plugins repository.](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Plugins_Repository/releases/latest) install that to your PS4 following the instructions found [here.](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Plugins_Repository#quick-start)

Download [**Rock Band 4 Deluxe**](#-downloads), Extract the zip somewhere on your PC.

Once that is complete, open the folder called `GoldHEN`.

Copy the `plugins` folder, `RB4DX` folder, and `plugins.ini` file to `/data/GoldHEN/` on your PS4.

If you already have a `plugins.ini` on your PS4 and do not want to replace it, edit your current `plugins.ini` file to add these lines:

```ini
; Rock Band 4 Deluxe Plugins
;US
[CUSA02084]
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/RB4DX-Plugin.prx
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/no_share_watermark.prx
;EU
[CUSA02901]
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/RB4DX-Plugin.prx
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/no_share_watermark.prx
```

To update RB4DX, first delete the `ps4` folder in the `/data/GoldHEN/RB4DX/` folder on your ps4, then follow the steps above again (you do not need to edit `plugins.ini` if you have edited it for RB4DX before).

If the plugin is not loading, you may need to change the file permissions of the plugin to allow it to run. This can be done with the PS4/GoldHen Cheats Manager, in the settings there is a button labelled `Set file permissions for Plugins`, pressing this should make the plugin load correctly.

If the plugin is loading, but no dx modifications are showing up, then you may need to change the permissions of the RB4DX folder on the PS4, or retransfer the RB4DX folder entirely

## üì© Installing on ShadPS4

Download [**Rock Band 4 Deluxe (1.08)**](#-downloads), Extract the zip somewhere on your PC.

Once that is complete, open the folder called `GoldHEN`.

open the `plugins` folder, and copy the file inside it to the `sce_module` folder in the games files (right click rb4, open folder->open game folder).

Then copy the `RB4DX-1.08` folder to `user/data/CUSA02084/GoldHEN/` in the emulator files. If the folder doesn't exist, create it.

To update RB4DX, first delete the `ps4` folder in the `user/data/CUSA02084/GoldHEN/RB4DX-1.08/` folder on your ps4, then follow the steps above again.
