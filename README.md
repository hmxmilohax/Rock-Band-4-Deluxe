### Initializing the Repo

* Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-4-deluxe/releases)** of this repo and **download `_init_repo.py`**.
  * Make a new **empty** folder, **put `_init_repo.py` in the folder, and run it**. This will pull the repo down for you and make sure you're completely up to date. **This will take some time.**

### ***The folder should look like this once it's done:***
